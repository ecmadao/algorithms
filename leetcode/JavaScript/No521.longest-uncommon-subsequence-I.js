 * Desc:
 * Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings.
 * The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
 * The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "aba", "cdc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"),
 * because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba",
 * but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings.
 *
 * Note:
 * 1. Both strings' lengths will not exceed 100.
 * 2. Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.
 *
 * 给定两个字符串，你需要从这两个字符串中找出最长的特殊序列。最长特殊序列定义如下：该序列为某字符串独有的最长子序列（即不能是其他字符串的子序列）。
 * 子序列可以通过删去字符串中的某些字符实现，但不能改变剩余字符的相对顺序。空序列为所有字符串的子序列，任何字符串为其自身的子序列。
 * 输入为两个字符串，输出最长特殊序列的长度。如果不存在，则返回 -1。
 *
 * 示例:
 * 输入: "aba", "cdc"
 * 输出: 3
 * 解析: 最长特殊序列可为 "aba" (或 "cdc")
 *
 * 说明:
 * 1. 两个字符串长度均小于100。
 * 2. 字符串中的字符仅含有 'a'~'z'。
